# CommonLibSSE-NG Plugin Template

This is a basic plugin template using CommonLibSSE-NG.

### Requirements
* [XMake](https://xmake.io) [2.8.2+]

cd commonlibsse-ng-template
```

### Build
To build the project, run the following command:

```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `build/windows/` directory in the **project's root directory** with the build output.*

### Build Output (Optional)
If you want to redirect the build output, set one of or both of the following environment variables:

- Path(s) to a Skyrim install folder: `XSE_TES5_GAME_PATH`

- Path(s) to a Mod Manager mods folder: `XSE_TES5_MODS_PATH`

> ***Note:*** *Both variables support semicolon (`;`) seperated paths for multiple game installs or `mods` folders.*

### Project Generation (Optional)
If you want to generate a Visual Studio project, run the following command:
```bat
xmake project -k vsxmake
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `vsxmakeXXXX/` directory in the **project's root directory** using the latest version of Visual Studio installed on the system.*
